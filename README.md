## Freetube Forwarder

I wanted to search and launch [Freetube](https://freetubeapp.io/) straight from the browser, so I've added a [search engine](https://mycroftproject.com/install.html?id=121990&basename=freetube-protocol&icontype=png&name=Freetube) to the Mycroft project that uses this page as a proxy to launch `freetube://` intents. It also converts non-URLs to regular searches.
